# Module_12_Challenge

## Overview of the Project 

####  The purpose of this challenge was to create a website using Javascript that would feature information regarding UFOs. Using javascript, we created tables that could be used to filter through different UFO sightings. These filters can be usedto change the types of sightings and area in which  the sighting occured. 

## Results

#### The filtering table allows you to search for cities, dates, and states in which UFO sightings have occured. You can change any of the information listed to show sightings related to that specific search. Multiple options can be chosen at a time to tailor your search to specific needs.

## Summary 

### Drawbacks and Reccomendations 

#### One potential drawback of our search bar is that the filters could be more in depth in regardsto the options provided. We could further filter data by times, days of the week, potentially weather patterns, and so on. For reccomendations, I believe that in the future we could reformat the site to include multiple pages and perhaps a more clean user interface when looking at the table. The current interface is a bit bulky and difficult to read all of the data at once. Being able to seperate types of searches to different tables or pages and display them seperately would be helpful.
